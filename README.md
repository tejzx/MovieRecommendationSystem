# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 🚀 Overview
This project aims to build a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user preferences. The system utilizes **collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches** to enhance recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- **Movie details**: Titles, genres, descriptions, and release year.
- **User interaction data**: Ratings, watch history, and user preferences.
- **Metadata**: Cast, crew, and movie keywords.

## 🛠️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation.git
cd Movie-Recommendation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Feature extraction from movie descriptions and genres.
- Encoding categorical data for machine learning models.

## 🤖 Recommendation Models
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has liked.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user interaction patterns.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both techniques for better accuracy.

## 📈 Key Insights
- User preferences play a significant role in personalized recommendations.
- Content-based recommendations improve when combined with metadata.
- Collaborative filtering enhances recommendations for users with a strong watch history.

## 📌 How to Use
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook MovieRecommendation.ipynb
```
Modify hyperparameters in `src/model_training.py` to experiment with different models.
